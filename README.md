# Team Profile Generator

## Project Summary

The goal of this assignment was to build a Node.js command-line application that prompts the manager to input information about their employees on their software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Then create unit tests to make sure all of our code works. We also  needed to intall Inquire for command-line interface and Jest for testing.
